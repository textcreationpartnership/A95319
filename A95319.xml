         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Scot</hi> Reports from the Councel of State, a Letter and Paper concerning a CeÅ¿Å¿ation made by Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> with General <hi>Owen Roe mac Art O Neal,</hi> Å¿ent to the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> and were by the Lord Lieutenant brought and delivered to the Councel, and by them taken into conÅ¿ideration, and that the whole BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s was then diÅ¿approved by the Councel; and the Councel hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> That they neither did nor do approve of what he hath done therein; and Ordered, That both the foreÅ¿aid Letter and Papers, and alÅ¿o the ReaÅ¿ons now exhibited to the Councel by Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> for his making the CeÅ¿Å¿ation, Å¿hould be Reported to the HouÅ¿e; which were all this day read.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The HouÅ¿e being informed, That Colonel</hi> Monk <hi>was at the door, he was called in; and being come to the Bar,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker by Commands of the HouÅ¿e declared to him, That the HouÅ¿e had received a Report from the Councel of State, touching an Agreement for a CeÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between him and <hi>Owen Roe;</hi> and whereas in his Letter he doth mention, That he had done it with advice with Å¿ome others there, Mr. Speaker demanded of him, what perÅ¿ons he intended thereby: To which Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> anÅ¿wered, That he did it upon his own Å¿core, without the advice of any other perÅ¿on; onely having formerly had DiÅ¿courÅ¿e with Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> Colonel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115854:3"/>
               <hi>Jones</hi> told him, That if he the Å¿aid Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> could keep off <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> from joyning, it would be a good Å¿ervice.</p>
            <p>Being demanded by Mr. Speaker, Whether he had any advice or direction from the Parliament, or Councel of State, or Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other perÅ¿on here to do the Å¿ame; he did expreÅ¿ly deny, That he had any advice or direction therein from the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or from the Councel of State, or from the Parliament, or any Member of either; but he did it onely on his own Å¿core, conceiving it was for the preÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the EngliÅ¿h IntereÅ¿t there, and that they have had Å¿ome fruits thereof accordingly.</p>
            <p>Being withdrawn, and afterwards called in again, the queÅ¿tions demanded him by Mr. Speaker, and his anÅ¿wers thereunto, were read unto him; and the Å¿aid Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> did acknowledge, That the Å¿ame are his anÅ¿wers to the Å¿aid queÅ¿tions.</p>
            <p>REÅ¿olved, &amp;c. <hi>That this HouÅ¿e doth utterly diÅ¿approve of the proceedings of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel</hi> Monk, <hi>in the Treaty and CeÅ¿Å¿ation made between him and</hi> Owen Roe O Neal; <hi>And that the innocent Blood which hath been Å¿hed in</hi> Ireland, <hi>is Å¿o freÅ¿h in the memory of this HouÅ¿e, that this HouÅ¿e doth deteÅ¿t and abhor the thoughts of any cloÅ¿ing with any party of PopiÅ¿h Rebels there, who have had their hands in Å¿hedding that blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NevertheleÅ¿s, the HouÅ¿e being Å¿atisfied that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115854:3"/>what the Å¿aid Colonel</hi> Monk <hi>did therein, was in his apprehenÅ¿ion neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the preÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>IntereÅ¿t, That the HouÅ¿e is content the further conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof, as to him, be laid aÅ¿ide, and Å¿hall not at any time hereafter be called in queÅ¿tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ordered, <hi>That it be referred to the Councel of State, to give Direction for printing the Report from the Councel of State, and Å¿o much of the Letters and Proceedings as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and the Votes of the HouÅ¿e thereupon.</hi>

                  </opener>
                  <p>SInce I received advertiÅ¿ement of your reÅ¿olution of coming into this Kingdom, I have very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and withal do aÅ¿Å¿ure you, that you have no Å¿ervant in the world more glad of it, then my Å¿elf; I am infinitely obliged to you for your many favors, for which I return you hearty thanks. I do account it a principal part of my duty, to give you account of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs here in this Å¿ervice: I have, Å¿ince, the Scots de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erting me (although they are unwilling to own it) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding their actions do fully manifeÅ¿t it, uÅ¿ed my utmoÅ¿t endeavors to reÅ¿erve the intereÅ¿t of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the North, and to keep Å¿ome footing there. I have taken care to provide the GarriÅ¿on of <hi>LiÅ¿negarvy,</hi> with two moneths proviÅ¿ion of corn, which is kept there Å¿afe, if any rupture happen between, which is likely to be, Å¿ince their ends are clear oppoÅ¿ite: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o I have well furniÅ¿hed with victual the GarriÅ¿on of <hi>Derry,</hi> the onely paÅ¿s into the North, and <hi>Green CaÅ¿tle, Cartingford, Dundalk</hi> and <hi>Colerane,</hi> if my Forces Å¿hould advance to beÅ¿iege either of them. And being in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill condition with theÅ¿e GarriÅ¿ons between the Scots and IriÅ¿h, <hi>Owen mac Art</hi>'s Army, I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, by the advice of Å¿ome Å¿pecial friends and well-wiÅ¿hers to this Service, to treat with <hi>Owen mac Art,</hi> to keep him from joyning with <hi>Ormond,</hi> which if he had done, Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> and I had been in a very great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115854:4"/>of loÅ¿ing the Parliaments footing in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; whereupon finding Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> in Å¿uch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he could not relieve me, it made me the more confident to adventure upon a CeÅ¿Å¿ation of Arms between <hi>Owen mac Art</hi>'s Party and mine, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging himÅ¿elf to oppoÅ¿e <hi>Ormond,</hi> which he doth really intend to do, and hath already by his endeavors ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿ted his willingneÅ¿s to ruine <hi>Ormond,</hi> for a greater feud cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be between them, then there is now: wherefore upon this Å¿core I have treated with him, and according to his deÅ¿ire, Å¿ent you the Copy of the PropoÅ¿itions made by him, and according to his deÅ¿ire Å¿ent you the Copy of the PropoÅ¿itions made by him, to the Parliament, which are wonderful high, but I believe will deÅ¿cend much lower: I have Å¿ent you likewiÅ¿e a Copy of Agreement for the three moneths CeÅ¿Å¿ation betwixt <hi>Owen mac Art</hi> and I. I do not think it fit to Å¿ignifie this to the Councel of State, but do wholly refer the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to you, either to make further uÅ¿e of it, or elÅ¿e to move it, or as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moÅ¿t fit to be done, Å¿ince there was great neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity for me to do it, I hope it will beget no ill conÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when the advantage gained to the Service, by dividing <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Mac Art,</hi> is fully weighed.</p>
                  <p>By this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s I have very much quieted the Scots, who were upon Å¿o high terms, that nothing would Å¿atisfie them, but that I muÅ¿t deliver up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ions, Arms and Ammunition to them which I had in my Stores, as you may perceive by the Copies of their Letters at their meetings; but now they do not Å¿tir, either to Å¿end Forces to joyn with thoÅ¿e againÅ¿t <hi>Derry,</hi> or to advance towards me: wherefore being driven to this great Å¿treight, I Å¿hall deÅ¿ire that it may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115854:5"/>not receive any ill cenÅ¿ure, but that it may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conÅ¿idered.</p>
                  <p>I doubt I have already treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ed too much upon your time, and do therefore crave pardon for this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and humbly beÅ¿eech you to continue your good opinion towards me, and eÅ¿teem me, as I am</p>

               <head>The REASONS inducing Colonel <hi>Monk to</hi> make a CeÅ¿Å¿ation with <hi>Owen Roe O Neal</hi> for three Moneths, which is now expired, were as followeth:</head>
               <list>
                  <item>1. THat about <hi>April</hi> laÅ¿t, the Scots under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand having relinquiÅ¿hed their obedience to the Parliament, and denied to obey any command from him, upon refuÅ¿ing to joyn with them in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration againÅ¿t the Parliament and Army, he deÅ¿ired aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance from Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> to reduce them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: But Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> finding by good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> had made a Peace with all the IriÅ¿h, except <hi>Owen Roe O Neal;</hi> That he had Å¿et up the Princes IntereÅ¿t, and upon that Å¿core was raiÅ¿ing all the force he could make to diÅ¿treÅ¿s Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> in his quarters, thought it not Å¿afe, as to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments IntereÅ¿t in <hi>LemÅ¿ter,</hi> to Å¿pare any aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance to Colonel <hi>Monk.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> being upon this neceÅ¿Å¿itated to retire to his GariÅ¿on of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> found <hi>Owen Roe O Neal</hi> quartered with his Forces, being Six thouÅ¿and Foot, and about Seven hundred horÅ¿e, in the counties of <hi>Cavan</hi> and <hi>Monahan,</hi> within twenty or thirty miles march of his GarriÅ¿on; and alÅ¿o received good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> at that time uÅ¿ed all poÅ¿Å¿ible means to draw <hi>Owen Roe</hi> to his party, offering him any Conditions to induce to it.</item>
                  <item>3. That Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> finding himÅ¿elf thus inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Scots on the one hand, with whom he underÅ¿tood the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> kept Intelligence at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115854:7"/>that time, and with <hi>Owen Roe</hi> on the other; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how dangerous it would in all probability be, not onely to himÅ¿elf, but alÅ¿o to Colonel <hi>Jones,</hi> and Å¿o conÅ¿equently to all the Parliaments IntereÅ¿t in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to have <hi>Owen Roe</hi> and the Scots thus upon the Å¿udden, and before any Forces could be expected to arrive out of <hi>England,</hi> either to Colonel <hi>Jones</hi> or his own relief, united with the Lord of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Finding that if he could keep the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Owen Roe</hi> at diÅ¿tance, until Å¿upplies arrived, he Å¿hould not onely deprive the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> of that acceÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿trength which <hi>Owen Roe</hi>'s Forces would have added unto him, but alÅ¿o render the Scots in <hi>UlÅ¿ter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> with his <hi>Connaght</hi> Forces (all which being joyned together, would have made Twelve thouÅ¿and horÅ¿e and foot) uÅ¿eleÅ¿s to the Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as to any aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance he could expect from them to joyn with him againÅ¿t Colonel <hi>Jones, Owen Roe</hi> lying Å¿o with his Forces, as that he might within two or three days march, have fallen either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scots quarters, or <hi>Clanrickards</hi> quarters, if they had not kept their Forces to attend his motions.</item>
                  <item>5. Finding alÅ¿o that <hi>Owen Roe,</hi> in regard of his own Å¿afety, would accept the large Offers made him by the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> if he had not been Å¿peedily prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> well weighing all the dangers and advantages as aforeÅ¿aid, that might in all probability inÅ¿ue thereupon; and likewiÅ¿e what hazard it might have been to retard a concluÅ¿ion with <hi>Owen Roe</hi> (whom he found impatient of all Delays) until he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Directions either from the Councel of State or the Parliament, for his farther proceeding therein, thought it moÅ¿t agreeable to the diÅ¿charge of his truÅ¿t,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115854:8"/>and the Å¿afety of the Parliaments IntereÅ¿t in that Kingdom, rather to caÅ¿t himÅ¿elf upon the Parliaments favorable interpretation, and to conclude a CeÅ¿Å¿ation with <hi>Owen Roe</hi> for three moneths, then by any further delay, to loÅ¿e the advantages aforeÅ¿aid, the fruits whereof have in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure anÅ¿wered his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prevented the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> all this while from a Å¿trict beÅ¿ieging of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Å¿o conÅ¿equently of taking it, for want of a competent number of foot to lie down before it, which he could not have done, without the addition of the Scots and <hi>Connaght</hi> forces as aforeÅ¿aid; and in the mean time neceÅ¿Å¿itated him to Å¿pend his time in taking of the out-GariÅ¿ons, which if <hi>Dublin</hi> had been taken, he knew would have Å¿peedily fallen into his hands. The truth of all which, and of the advantages gained by his proceedings, he Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the further teÅ¿timony of thoÅ¿e that Command in chief for the Parliament upon the place.</item>
